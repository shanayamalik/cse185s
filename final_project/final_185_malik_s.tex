\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{N}{eonatal} neurodevelopmental monitoring is an important aspect of neonatal care, essential for the early detection and intervention of neurological disorders. The introduction of adaptive telemetry systems represents a significant advancement in the medical-technology field, offering continuous and real-time brain activity monitoring. The systems promise to revolutionize the current standards of neonatal care by providing more accurate and comprehensive insights into the neurodevelopmental health of newborns, particularly those at high risk for neurological impairments. The development of portable monitoring systems for Android devices has the potential to be a promising solution for cases in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, offering cost-effective and mobile alternatives for EEG monitoring.

\subsection{Background and Motivation}
The consistent monitoring of neonatal brain activity is important for early detection and intervention in neurological issues. Neonates, especially those born prematurely, are at a heightened risk of impairments due to various factors such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), genetic conditions, and environmental stressors. In the early identification of such conditions, it can improve outcomes through timely and targeted interventions.

The traditional methods of brain monitoring, such as clinical observation and standard electroencephalography (EEG), have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity refers to the ability of a method to correctly identify those with a condition (true positive rate), while specificity is the ability to correctly identify those without the condition (true negative rate). The limitations from clinical observation and standard EEG can result in a higher likelihood of misreading or interpreting data, leading to unreliable information regarding a neonate's health. 

There are recent technological advancements that have introduced adaptive telemetry systems which offer continuous and real-time monitoring of neonatal brain activity. The systems integrate advanced EEG techniques with machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and reliability of neurodevelopmental assessments. For example, adaptive telemetry systems use a multi-channel EEG recordings and signal processing algorithms to accurately detect and classify neurological events. In particular, machine learning models have shown promise in identifying complex patterns in EEG data that may be indicative of early neurological abnormalities.

The integration of these technologies promises to improve neonatal care by providing more precise and actionable insights into brain health. The continuous monitoring allows for the detection of subclinical seizures and other subtle abnormalities that might otherwise go unnoticed. Early detection facilitates timely interventions that can mitigate the impact of neurological injuries and improve long-term outcomes for neonates. Furthermore, adaptive telemetry systems can provide valuable data for ongoing research, contributing to a deeper understanding of neonatal neurodevelopment and the factors that influence it.

Adaptive telemetry systems also offer the potential to decentralize neonatal care. By enabling remote monitoring, these systems can extend the reach of expert neonatal care to rural or underserved areas. This decentralization can lead to more equitable healthcare access, ensuring that all neonates, regardless of their geographical location, receive high-quality neurodevelopmental monitoring and timely interventions. Additionally, the continuous data generated by these systems can be used to develop predictive models that anticipate neurodevelopmental issues, further enhancing early intervention strategies.

The advancement of portable EEG monitoring systems for Android devices exemplifies the potential to enhance neonatal neurodevelopmental monitoring further. These systems provide a low-cost, mobile solution that is particularly beneficial in resource-limited settings. Portable EEG devices, coupled with smartphone technology, facilitate continuous brain health assessment through EEG sonification, making real-time monitoring more intuitive and accessible. The ability to convert EEG signals into audible sound leverages the human ear's capability to detect changes in frequency characteristics, enabling faster and more efficient monitoring.
