\section{Current Practical Applications of Adaptive Telemetry Systems for Monitoring Neonatal Brain Development}

\IEEEPARstart{A}{daptive} telemetry systems, such as amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), are important for monitoring neonatal brain development. The systems provide continuous, real-time data that aid in the early diagnosis and intervention of neurological conditions in neonates, a newborn that is of age four weeks or less. 

\subsection{Amplitude-Integrated EEG (aEEG)}

\subsubsection{Overview of aEEG}
The amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) has become a standard tool in neonatal neurological care. It was developed in 1960 for adults and was later modified for neonates with the intention of providing continuous monitoring of brain function. The aEEG is particularly useful for detecting seizures and assessing brain activity in neonates with hypoxia-ischemia and other neurological conditions \cite{IEEEhowto:toet}.

\subsubsection{Practical Applications in Neonatal Care}
The aEEG is routinely used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for several applications, including but not limited to the following. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detection of Seizures:} aEEG provides continuous monitoring that can detect both clinical and subclinical seizures.  
    \item \textbf{Assessment of Brain Function Post-Hypoxia:} aEEG is used to evaluate the brain function of neonates who have experienced perinatal asphyxia.  
    \item \textbf{Monitoring in Preterm Infants:} aEEG is also valuable in monitoring the brain function of preterm infants.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Considerations and Challenges}
The use of aEEG in clinical practice can include challenges, as artefacts such as ECG interference and movement artefacts can lead to misinterpretations. The integration of EEG alongside aEEG in newer devices helps mitigate issues, allowing for more accurate interpretation of brain activity \cite{IEEEhowto:toet}.

\subsection{Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)}

\subsubsection{Overview of NIRS}
Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method for monitoring tissue oxygenation and cerebral hemodynamics. NIRS measures regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2), providing valuable data on the brain's oxygen supply. 

\subsubsection{Technical Considerations and Challenges}
NIRS faces challenges, primarily related to movement artefacts and the need for proper fixation of the transducer. 

\subsection{Integration of aEEG and NIRS}
The combination of aEEG and NIRS provide a comprehensive approach to neonatal brain monitoring, as aEEG focuses on electrical brain activity and NIRS provides data on cerebral oxygenation. The integration of the two enhances the ability to monitor and manage neonatal neurodevelopmental issues.
